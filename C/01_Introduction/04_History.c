// History Of C 
// The C programming language has a rich history that dates back to the early 1970s. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs as an evolution of the B programming language, which itself was derived from BCPL. C was designed to provide low-level access to memory while still being high-level enough to write complex programs.
// 1967 : 
// BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) was developed by Martin Richards at the University of Cambridge. It was a high-level language that influenced many later languages, including C.

// 1970 :  Ken Thompson at Bell Labs develps B , a simplified version of BCPL. B was designed for system programming and was used to write the Unix operating system.
// 1972 : Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs develops C, building on the concepts of B and BCPL. C was designed to be a systems programming language that could be used to write operating systems and other low-level software.
// 1978 : The first edition of "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernigh
// 1989 : The ANSI C standard is established, formalizing the language and its features. This version is often referred to as C89 or C90.
// 1990 : The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopts the ANSI C standard, leading to the creation of ISO C. This version is also known as C90.
// 20211 : The C11 standard is released, introducing several new features and improvements to the language, such as multithreading support, improved Unicode support, and enhanced type-generic programming capabilities. C11 is designed to be backward compatible with previous versions of C while providing modern programming features.
// 2018 : The C18 standard is released, which is a bug-fix release of C11. It does not introduce new features but addresses defects in the C11 standard.
// C23 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2023) is the latest revision and include better support for the const qualifier, new and updated library functions, and further optimizations for compiler implementations.
