<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

We want to find two indices i and j such that:

```javascript
nums[i] + nums[j] === target;
```

Create a Map (hash table) to store each number we've seen so far and its index.

The key is the number, and the value is its index in the array.

```javascript
const map = new Map();
```

Loop through each number in the array.

For the current number nums[i], calculate its complement, which is the number that needs to pair with nums[i] to reach the target.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    ...
}


```

Check if the complement already exists in the map.

If yes, you've found the pair: return the index of the complement (from the map) and the current index i.

```javascript
if (map.has(complement)) {
  return [map.get(complement), i];
}
```

If the complement wasn't found, store the current number and its index in the map.

This way, future iterations can check against it.

```javascript
map.set(nums[i], i);
```

# Code

```javascript []
var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  // number -> index
  const map = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      console.log([map.get(complement), i]);
      // return the pair of indices
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }

  // If no solution is found (though problem guarantees one solution)
  return [];
};
```
