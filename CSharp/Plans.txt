Core C# Language Features:
Asynchronous Programming (async/await):
Deep understanding of Task and Task<T>, async/await keywords, and handling asynchronous operations for performance and responsiveness.
Generics:
Advanced usage of generic types and methods, including constraints, covariance, and contravariance.
Delegates, Events, and Lambda Expressions:
Comprehensive understanding of their roles in event-driven programming and functional programming paradigms.
LINQ (Language Integrated Query):
Mastering various LINQ providers (LINQ to Objects, LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework Core), deferred execution, and performance considerations.
Reflection and Attributes:
Utilizing reflection for dynamic code execution and understanding how to create and use custom attributes.
Advanced Exception Handling:
Strategies for robust error handling, including custom exceptions, global exception handling, and retry mechanisms.
Advanced .NET Concepts:
Multithreading and Concurrency:
In-depth knowledge of Thread, ThreadPool, Task Parallel Library (TPL), and synchronization primitives like lock, Mutex, Semaphore.
Dependency Injection (DI) and IoC Containers:
Understanding the principles of DI and using frameworks like Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for building loosely coupled applications.
Design Patterns:
Familiarity with common design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy) and their application in C# development.
Memory Management and Performance Optimization:
Understanding garbage collection, memory profiling, and techniques for optimizing application performance.
Networking and Web Technologies:
Advanced topics in ASP.NET Core (Middleware, Filters, Routing), Web APIs, SignalR, and gRPC.
Testing and Quality Assurance:
Unit testing with frameworks like xUnit or NUnit, integration testing, and mocking frameworks.
Security Best Practices:
Implementing secure coding practices, authentication, and authorization in .NET applications.
Architectural and Methodological Concepts:
SOLID Principles:
Applying the Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD):
Understanding core DDD concepts like aggregates, entities, value objects, and bounded contexts.
Microservices Architecture:
Designing and implementing distributed systems using microservices.
Cloud-Native Development:
Familiarity with cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP) and services relevant to .NET development.
